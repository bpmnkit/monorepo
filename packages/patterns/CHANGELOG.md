## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 9d412da: Coordinated release of every published package

  `@bpmnkit/core` carries fixes that have been on `main` since the last release but never
  shipped — `compactify()`/`expand()` keeping `<bpmn:documentation>` through the operations
  API (#150) among them, which is still reported as reproducing because the newest artifact
  on npm predates the fix. Bumping every publishable package releases the workspace as one
  set, so no consumer resolves a core that a sibling package was never built against.

  Nothing here changes behaviour beyond what each package's own changesets describe.
