# Search related incidents

`POST /process-instances/{processInstanceKey}/incidents/search`

Search for incidents caused by the process instance or any of its called process or decision instances.

Although the `processInstanceKey` is provided as a path parameter to indicate the root process instance,
you may also include a `processInstanceKey` within the filter object to narrow results to specific
child process instances. This is useful, for example, if you want to isolate incidents associated with
subprocesses or called processes under the root instance while excluding incidents directly tied to the root.
